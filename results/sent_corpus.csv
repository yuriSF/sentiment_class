25747,721,It 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .,,,
66551,3631,It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .,,,
224173,4287,"It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .",,,
25748,1200,It 's fascinating to see how Bettany and McDowell play off each other .,,,
185110,10058,It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .,,,

185149,10349,"It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .",,,
185150,10112,It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .,,,
106904,4562,"It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .",,,
66585,4046,It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .,,,

185208,10326,It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .,,,
185209,11533,It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .,,,
146617,8915,It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .,,,
224238,1640,"It 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation .",,,
45751,1385,It 's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable American remake .,,,
106952,5684,"It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .",,,
146618,7641,"It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .",,,
185210,9157,"It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .",,,

14165,86,"It 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other Best Picture contenders should be measured .",,,
66674,3500,It 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts Blue Crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies .,,,
224253,1289,It 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .,,,
