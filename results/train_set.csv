182714,9895,"Basically , it 's pretty but dumb ."

182726,11202,Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
222559,11847,Bearable .
104650,6646,Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
182728,11219,Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
104654,4508,"Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness ."
64274,3876,"Beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the Marquis de Sade had gone in for pastel landscapes ."

104661,4810,"Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself ."
64302,4445,"Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before ."
64305,3154,"Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin ."

182760,11181,"Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance ."

182783,9230,"Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow ."
104697,6721,"Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice ."

44726,2214,"Birthday Girl lucks out with Chaplin and Kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns ."

104821,4765,Both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes .
104823,5248,Both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics .

104838,6271,"Boy oh boy , it 's a howler ."
144249,7077,"Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism ."
182887,10265,"Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation ."
64453,4130,"Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , Haneke 's portrait of an upper class Austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt ."

144303,7161,"Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy ."
222711,7135,"But , for that , why not watch a documentary ?"
222712,2342,"But , like Silence , it 's a movie that gets under your skin ."

222750,10064,But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
222751,9958,But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .
222752,6643,"But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie ."
222753,1743,"But if you 've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there 's guilty fun to be had here ."
222759,4150,But it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .
222760,2057,But it 's defiantly and delightfully against the grain .
222762,7237,But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
222763,3107,But it 's hardly a necessary enterprise .
222764,11593,But it 's surprisingly harmless .
222766,4869,But it 's worth the concentration .
222767,5662,But it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won .
222768,3626,But it also has many of the things that made the first one charming .

222774,6626,"But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness ."
222775,2175,But it is entertaining on an inferior level .
222776,9495,"But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit ."
222778,10066,But it was n't .
222779,1993,"But it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker ."
222780,11153,But it would be better to wait for the video .
222782,11070,But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
222785,6778,"But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted ."
222786,5088,"But mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived ."
222787,5778,But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti

106815,5498,It 's a scorcher .
66497,2673,"It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast ."

224136,5543,"It 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries ."

66510,2730,"It 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear ."
224140,3022,"It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun ."

106823,5605,It 's a very valuable film ...
224143,7257,It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
66512,3896,"It 's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you do n't try to look too deep into the story"
66513,2497,"It 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout ."
66514,2290,"It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama ."
66515,2935,"It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic ."
66516,3176,"It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing ."
106827,5303,It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that 's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .
106828,5153,It 's about time .
224145,10845,It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
185042,10978,"It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places ."
185046,10878,It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
66517,2957,"It 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective ."
66518,3273,It 's all a rather shapeless good time ...
66519,3624,"It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect ."
185050,11383,"It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it ."
66520,3446,"It 's all entertaining enough , but do n't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper ."
185051,10055,"It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story ."
106829,5799,It 's all pretty tame .
66521,4458,"It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage ."
185052,9239,It 's all surface psychodramatics .
185053,9819,It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
185054,9227,"It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness ."
106831,5817,"It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget ."
224150,9155,It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
224153,9940,It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
106832,5185,It 's always enthralling .
66522,3290,It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .
106833,5900,It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .
106834,5463,"It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones ."
66524,3567,"It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems ."
224160,4770,"It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it ."
106840,5446,"It 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space ."
106841,4955,"It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter ."
66528,3967,It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .
185058,11210,"It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise ."
66534,2282,It 's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing .
106842,5323,"It 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes ."
66535,2953,It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
224161,2883,It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .
185059,10827,"It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself ."
146450,6923,It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
224163,10863,"It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here ."
224164,10815,It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
66541,2679,It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
185071,10624,"It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows ."
185072,9719,"It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness ."
185073,9213,It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
146458,7066,"It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure ."
224165,10062,It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .
224166,488,It 's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion .
45731,2195,It 's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our Hollywood has all but lost .
185085,10076,"It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind ."
146460,7045,It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
106843,6364,"It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades ."
66542,3827,"It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen ."
146464,6974,It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
66544,2666,"It 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime ."
106844,4535,It 's clear that Mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of Indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .
185086,10917,"It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf ."
106845,6318,"It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long ."
185091,10192,"It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate ."
66545,4383,"It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought ."
66549,2455,"It 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old Ferris Bueller ."
185092,10676,It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
224167,9133,"It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death"
106852,5177,It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .
185094,10832,It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
106853,4499,It 's definitely a step in the right direction .
66550,4388,"It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously ."
185099,10858,"It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting ."
185100,9588,It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .
185101,9464,It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .
185102,9731,"It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny ."
185103,10361,It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
185104,9656,"It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting ."
185105,11509,"It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 ."
224168,6490,It 's drab .
185106,9927,"It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast ."
106863,5534,"It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift ."
106868,6376,It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
45732,1880,"It 's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage ."
106869,4544,"It 's enough to watch Huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins ."
185107,9868,It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
185108,9556,It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .
185109,11603,It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
106874,4788,"It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists ."
66551,3631,It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .
224173,4287,"It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones ."
185110,10058,It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
146485,7009,It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
66553,2367,"It 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns De Palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s ."
224175,9654,"It 's fun , but it 's a real howler ."
66554,4096,"It 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty ."
66555,2416,"It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom ."
185111,11570,"It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true ."
66556,3627,"It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot ."
224176,4898,It 's funny .
66557,2457,"It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once ."
45734,1821,"It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart ."
66558,2413,It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
106880,5253,"It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas ."
66565,3642,"It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like ."
106881,6682,"It 's got the brawn , but not the brains ."
185116,10448,"It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive ."
185117,10722,It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
146496,6820,It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
185118,10162,"It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress ."
224178,3096,It 's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you 've seen the remake first .
224179,6498,It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
185119,9484,It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
106883,5981,"It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one ."
224184,2099,"It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone , but it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started ."
66567,2810,"It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb ."
185120,9933,It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
224185,11346,It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
224187,10116,"It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress ."
224189,9132,"It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?"
185128,11122,It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
146507,7236,"It 's harmless , diverting fluff ."
185132,10229,It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
66568,3563,"It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do ."
106884,6119,It 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .
185133,9307,It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
224190,3765,It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
106885,6181,It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
224191,9403,It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
146525,7185,It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
224193,10237,It 's just merely very bad .
106886,6481,It 's just not very smart .
185136,9608,It 's just plain boring .
146527,7238,It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
185137,10744,It 's just rather leaden and dull .
224194,10257,It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .
106887,6577,"It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain ."
185142,9095,"It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating ."
185143,10522,It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
185144,11067,It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
146533,6991,"It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking ."
66577,2840,"It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing ."
106892,5379,"It 's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness ."
224197,5103,"It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists ."
185145,10084,It 's like a drive-by .
106894,5980,It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .
224201,5424,"It 's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him ."
224202,3156,It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .
224203,11363,It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
185147,9842,It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
146538,6947,It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
185148,10862,It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
146544,7317,"It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it ."
66581,3106,"It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity ."
106903,6019,"It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through ."
185149,10349,"It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable ."
185150,10112,It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
106904,4562,"It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs ."
66585,4046,It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .
185155,10155,"It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments ."
66589,3409,It 's never dull and always looks good .
106910,4901,"It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing ."
106916,5681,"It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless ."
66590,3476,It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
66594,2330,It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
66595,2279,"It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke ."
185161,10969,"It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from ."
106917,6516,"It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie ."
66600,3451,"It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look ."
106922,6635,"It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable ."
45744,1742,It 's not a great monster movie .
224211,3496,It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
185166,11358,"It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one ."
224212,11151,It 's not an easy one to review .
146551,7141,It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
106923,6032,It 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .
106925,6062,"It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental ."
66606,3518,"It 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on ."
106926,6326,It 's not hateful .
185168,9632,"It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter ."
224213,3113,"It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie ."
146557,7114,It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
224218,584,"It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but I liked it ."
66622,3789,"It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered ."
106932,5865,"It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time ."
185169,10435,It 's not original enough .
66626,3933,"It 's not particularly subtle ... However , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion ."
106938,4849,"It 's not particularly well made , but since I found myself howling more than cringing , I 'd say the film works ."
106939,6137,It 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy Lil ' Bow Wow .
66627,3285,It 's not the least of Afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history .
185176,9660,"It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors ."
224220,10696,It 's not too fast and not too slow .
185181,10698,It 's not too much of anything .
224223,10697,It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive .
146589,6988,It 's one long bore .
224224,2831,It 's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads .
45749,1679,It 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .
66632,2537,"It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history ."
224229,10943,"It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids ."
224230,6444,It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
224232,4239,"It 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless ."
185191,10378,"It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling ."
106941,6350,It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
66646,2800,"It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period ."
106942,6697,It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
224233,3790,It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .
185196,11524,"It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances ."
185197,9938,It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
224234,2832,It 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
66649,3795,It 's quite diverting nonsense .
66650,3312,It 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as The Son 's Room .
185201,9221,It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
106947,4981,"It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette ."
224235,6008,It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
185202,11357,"It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows ."
185206,9264,"It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly ."
66651,3397,It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
66652,3633,It 's secondary to American Psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours .
106949,6327,"It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical ."
106950,5997,"It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun ."
146615,7331,It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
146616,6800,"It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence ."
185208,10326,It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .
185209,11533,It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
106952,5684,"It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny ."
185210,9157,"It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary ."
106953,4670,"It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon ."
66653,3190,"It 's something of the ultimate Scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful New York gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas ."
106954,6110,It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .
224242,5279,"It 's sort of in-between , and it works ."
224244,4309,"It 's still Adam Sandler , and it 's not Little Nicky ."
66668,2272,"It 's still a comic book , but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul ."
224245,6135,It 's still terrible !
66669,2657,It 's stylishly directed with verve ...
224246,7035,"It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid ."
185214,11252,"It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up ."
185218,10261,It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
185219,11173,It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
185220,10080,It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
66670,3474,"It 's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series ."
106961,4808,"It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful ."
224247,4897,It 's sweet .
185225,10309,It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
224251,5934,"It 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied ."
66671,2323,It 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .
66672,4290,It 's that good .
224252,10146,It 's that painful .
66673,2524,It 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .
66674,3500,It 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts Blue Crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies .
66675,4384,"It 's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between Chaplin and Kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming ."
106968,6117,"It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful ."
45757,1801,It 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion .
185227,10035,It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
185228,9821,It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
106969,4893,It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .
185229,11559,"It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough ."
185230,10276,"It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name ."
185231,10849,It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
45759,2192,"It 's the perfect star vehicle for Grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona ."
224256,3891,It 's the sweet Cinderella story that `` Pretty Woman '' wanted to be .
66683,2364,"It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least ."
106973,6261,It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
106974,4793,It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .
224257,2476,It 's time to let your hair down -- Greek style .
185232,9200,It 's too bad nothing else is .
106975,6693,It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .
224263,4896,"It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work ."
146629,7020,It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
224264,4999,It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .
185233,9328,"It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance ."
185234,11531,It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
185235,9077,"It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo ."
45764,1752,"It 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie ."
66684,2649,"It 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible ."
185236,10512,"It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue ."
224265,6491,It 's uninteresting .
106978,5347,It 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year .
106979,5111,"It 's up to you to decide whether to admire these people 's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of American life ."
224268,2235,"It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting ."
66690,3599,"It 's very Beavis and Butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle ."
66691,3076,It 's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .
66692,3807,"It 's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids ."
106980,4945,It 's worth taking the kids to .
66697,2512,"It ai n't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year 's lame Musketeer , this Dumas adaptation entertains ."
185238,10212,It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
224269,10762,It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow .
106983,6232,It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
66698,4175,"It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out ."
185240,9177,It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
185241,10643,"It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television ."
185246,9754,"It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense ."
185247,10369,It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
45773,1962,It also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them .
185248,10889,It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
185249,9630,It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
106984,4928,"It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications ."
66699,3230,It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .
224270,11802,It bites hard .
185255,10507,"It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely ."
224273,10588,"It ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to ."
106985,5602,It can be safely recommended as a video\/DVD babysitter .
45774,1712,"It celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what Hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light . '"

146650,7022,It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
66700,2701,"It cooks Conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle ."
185263,9432,"It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress ."
224276,1588,"It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you ."
185264,11112,"It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum ."

106991,5142,It deserves to be seen everywhere .
185269,11090,"It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time ."
224277,10692,It did n't go straight to video .
45778,1924,"It does give a taste of the Burning Man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity ."

106997,6352,It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
185271,9185,"It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject ."
224289,3330,"It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received ."
224290,11130,"It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events ."
185273,11259,"It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that ."

224296,6248,"It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose ."

107001,5874,It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
185281,10137,"It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes ."
224298,7292,It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
224301,5160,"It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling ."
107004,5882,It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .

185283,10844,It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
66714,4081,It grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration .
66715,3032,"It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame ."
107005,4647,"It has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out ."
66716,3313,"It has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at ."
185284,11279,It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .

45789,1804,"It has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and Mandy Moore leaves a positive impression ."
185285,9629,"It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline ."
45790,1673,It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .
224312,9900,"It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down ."
224313,5848,It has plenty of laughs .
66719,3520,It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...
185287,9458,"It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition ."

107007,5873,It hates its characters .
224321,3701,"It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho-Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere ."
224326,4518,"It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it ."
66726,2286,"It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged ."
66727,3321,It is Scott 's convincing portrayal of Roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph .
66728,3762,"It is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one ."
66729,2960,"It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film ."
66730,4279,"It is a likable story , told with competence ."
224328,3617,It is a movie about passion .
224329,2176,"It is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see ."
66732,4188,"It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise ."
45805,1937,"It is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival ."
224332,2158,"It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity ."

66733,3733,"It is an indelible epic American story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives ."
66734,3429,It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
66735,3231,"It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients ."
185294,10046,"It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment ."
185295,11390,"It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously ."
45814,1881,It is definitely worth seeing .
185296,9160,"It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound ."
107012,4935,"It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story ."
107013,4727,It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .

107014,4472,"It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad ."
107015,6037,"It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd ."
146706,7120,"It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it ."
45816,1741,"It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth ."
224333,10236,It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
224334,5872,It is n't scary .
224335,10256,It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
45817,1892,"It is n't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems ."
107018,6673,It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
224337,2240,"It is not what you see , it is what you think you see ."
185298,9327,It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .
185299,9840,"It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill"
66736,2656,"It is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events ."
66737,3008,It is quite a vision .
66738,4178,It is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .
45819,1762,"It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter ."
185300,10129,"It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied ."
224341,6600,"It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag ."
107020,6528,"It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness ."

107025,6605,"It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film ."
224343,11134,It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
224344,5849,It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
185304,11027,"It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller ."
224345,6420,It labours as storytelling .
107028,5387,It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .

185310,10718,"It looks good , but it is essentially empty ."
107030,6599,"It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such ."
185311,10073,It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
224357,6797,"It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies ."
185312,9259,It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
45822,1953,It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .
45824,2053,"It makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing ."
185313,9696,It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
224358,6149,It makes me feel weird \/ Thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ Like puppies with broken legs \/ And butterflies that die \/ And movies starring pop queens
224359,10434,It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
146719,7303,It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
45825,1780,It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .
66743,2517,It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .
107032,5074,It may ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised Scooby-Doo shows or reruns .
66744,3434,It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .
224363,10145,It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
107037,5051,"It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer ."
45826,2156,"It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality"
66749,4441,"It may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate ."
224364,9507,It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate .
224365,11543,It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
66754,2893,"It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case ."
224367,4805,"It may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but I enjoyed Barbershop ."
224368,3639,"It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?"
224369,2731,"It may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ?"
107047,5151,"It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding ."
224374,4776,"It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied ."
66759,3404,"It may sound like a mere disease-of - the-week TV movie , but A Song For Martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses Seldahl and Wollter ."
185318,11231,It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
66764,4098,"It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard French film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience ."
185323,10069,"It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness ."
224381,3703,It must be in the genes .
66769,2756,It must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes .
224382,5838,"It never is , not fully ."
224383,6419,It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
185326,10579,"It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time ."
185327,9191,It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
107050,5030,It offers a glimpse of the Solomonic decision facing Jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
66770,4407,"It picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film ."
146733,6814,"It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness ."
224384,10447,"It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting ."
224385,2202,"It provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of Gaza ."
107052,4951,"It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction ."
224386,10370,"It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher ."
107053,4698,It rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide .
66771,2469,It reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death .
224387,1864,"It really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` Evelyn . '"
185334,11032,It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
66773,4016,"It remains to be seen whether Statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ?"
107054,4953,It says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense .
66774,2399,It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .
107059,4757,"It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is ."
66775,4421,It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
185339,11468,"It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between ."
185340,11370,"It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't ."
185346,11269,"It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring ."
107060,6631,It should have stayed there .
107061,5707,It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
66776,2853,It shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable .
185351,11194,"It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out ."
224391,6492,It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !
185352,10940,"It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie ."
146743,7089,"It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations ."
107063,6353,It still feels like a prison stretch .
224392,11645,It strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain .
224393,11600,It sucked .
224394,10002,"It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about ."
185364,9658,It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
66777,4314,"It tends to remind one of a really solid Woody Allen film , with its excellent use of New York locales and sharp writing"
224395,5988,"It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this !"
66778,3845,It treats Ana 's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film .
66779,3959,It trusts the story it sets out to tell .
66780,4043,It turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .
66781,3147,"It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking ."
107073,5274,It uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film .
185366,10173,It was a dark and stormy night ...
107075,5222,"It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at ."
66782,3320,It was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of Bullock Bubble and Hugh Goo .
224397,4899,It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt .
107077,4701,It will break your heart many times over .
107078,5626,It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .
66783,3892,It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .
224402,6012,"It wo n't harm anyone , but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it ."
66788,2423,"It wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , Finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a Saturday matinee ."
107080,5181,It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun .
66793,3710,"It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory ."
107085,6341,"It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction ."
224408,2109,"It would be disingenuous to call Reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex ."
146774,7094,"It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi ."
185367,10664,"It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny ."
66794,2665,It would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde 's classic satire .
146778,6790,It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
107089,5949,"It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty ."
66795,2975,It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .
66798,3207,Its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work .
66801,3693,Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story .
185378,10414,"Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess ."
185380,11479,Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
185383,10626,"Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience ."
66804,2440,"Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway ."
107097,4692,"Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy ."
66806,3067,Its director 's most substantial feature for some time .
66808,3804,Its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .
224410,3138,"Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude ."
66811,3295,"Its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart ."

108293,5923,"Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core ."

225467,8334,Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
186714,10266,Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .
46524,2079,Plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel .
